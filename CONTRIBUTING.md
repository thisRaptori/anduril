# Contributing

Suggestions and pull requests are highly encouraged! 

## Workflow

First, clone the repo:

1. `git clone https://github.com/thisRaptori/anduril.git`

For now there's no need for any tooling, and files are imported into the extension manually. This may have to change if the extension grows.

#### Loading into the browser

Using Chrome:

1.  Open `chrome://extensions`
1.  Check the `Developer mode` checkbox
1.  Click on the `Load unpacked extension` button
1.  Select the folder `anduril/src`

#### Working on features

1. Write your feature - make sure to follow the style of code shown in the other features where possible
1. To test your code, click the refresh button for the unpacked extension in the Chrome extensions page
1. Once you're happy with your feature, submit a PR!
